## Higher Order Functions

In Python functions are treated as first class citizens, allowing you to perform the following operations on functions:

- A function can take one or more functions as parameters
- A function can be returned as a result of another function
- A function can be modified
- A function can be assigned to a variable

In this section, we will cover:

1. Handling functions as parameters
2. Returning functions as return value from another functions
3. Using Python closures and decorators

### Function as a Parameter

```py
def sum_numbers(nums):  # normal function
    return sum(nums)    # a sad function abusing the built-in sum function :<

def higher_order_function(f, lst):  # function as a parameter
    summation = f(lst)
    return summation
result = higher_order_function(sum_numbers, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(result)       # 15
```

### Function as a Return Value

```py
def square(x):          # a square function
    return x ** 2

def cube(x):            # a cube function
    return x ** 3

def absolute(x):        # an absolute value function
    if x >= 0:
        return x
    else:
        return -(x)

def higher_order_function(type): # a higher order function returning a function
    if type == 'square':
        return square
    elif type == 'cube':
        return cube
    elif type == 'absolute':
        return absolute

result = higher_order_function('square')
print(result(3))       # 9
result = higher_order_function('cube')
print(result(3))       # 27
result = higher_order_function('absolute')
print(result(-3))      # 3
```

You can see from the above example that the higher order function is returning different functions depending on the passed parameter

## Python Closures

Python allows a nested function to access the outer scope of the enclosing function. This is is known as a Closure. Let us have a look at how closures work in Python. In Python, closure is created by nesting a function inside another encapsulating function and then returning the inner function. See the example below.

**Example:**

```py
def add_ten():
    ten = 10
    def add(num):
        return num + ten
    return add

closure_result = add_ten()
print(closure_result(5))  # 15
print(closure_result(10))  # 20
```
## Advantages of Closures

Why Use Closures?
Closures in Python offer several advantages over the normal way of defining functions. Here are some reasons why closures are beneficial:

1. Encapsulation:
    Closures allow for encapsulation by restricting access to the variables within the outer function. The inner function has access to the outer function's variables, but they are not directly accessible from outside the closure. This helps in creating a private scope for variables.

2.Data Persistence:
    Variables defined in the outer function persist in memory even after the outer function has finished execution. This enables the inner function to retain and use the values of those variables, providing a way to store and manage state.

3.Function Factories:
    Closures enable the creation of function factories. In the example, add_ten is a function factory that generates new functions (add) with a specific behavior (adding 10 to the input). This flexibility is useful in various scenarios, such as creating specialized functions dynamically.

4.Callback Functions:
    Closures are often used to create callback functions. The inner function can be passed as a callback to other functions, allowing for the customization of behavior within a specific context.

5.Readability and Maintainability:
    Closures can improve code readability and maintainability by keeping related functionality together. Variables used in a specific context are contained within the closure, making it easier to understand and modify code.

## Python Decorators

A decorator is a design pattern in Python that allows a user to add new functionality to an existing object without modifying its structure. Decorators are usually called before the definition of a function you want to decorate.

### Creating Decorators

To create a decorator function, we need an outer function with an inner wrapper function.

**Example:**

```py
# Normal function
def greeting():
    return 'Welcome to Python'
def uppercase_decorator(function):
    def wrapper():
        func = function()
        make_uppercase = func.upper()
        return make_uppercase
    return wrapper
g = uppercase_decorator(greeting)
print(g())          # WELCOME TO PYTHON

## Let us implement the example above with a decorator

'''This decorator function is a higher order function
that takes a function as a parameter'''
def uppercase_decorator(function):
    def wrapper():
        func = function()
        make_uppercase = func.upper()
        return make_uppercase
    return wrapper
@uppercase_decorator
def greeting():
    return 'Welcome to Python'
print(greeting())   # WELCOME TO PYTHON

```

### Applying Multiple Decorators to a Single Function

```py

'''These decorator functions are higher order functions
that take functions as parameters'''

# First Decorator
def uppercase_decorator(function):
    def wrapper():
        func = function()
        make_uppercase = func.upper()
        return make_uppercase
    return wrapper

# Second decorator
def split_string_decorator(function):
    def wrapper():
        func = function()
        splitted_string = func.split()
        return splitted_string

    return wrapper

@split_string_decorator
@uppercase_decorator     # order with decorators is important in this case - .upper() function does not work with lists
def greeting():
    return 'Welcome to Python'
print(greeting())   # WELCOME TO PYTHON
```

### Accepting Parameters in Decorator Functions

Most of the time we need our functions to take parameters, so we might need to define a decorator that accepts parameters.

```py
def decorator_with_parameters(function):
    def wrapper_accepting_parameters(para1, para2, para3):
        function(para1, para2, para3)
        print("I live in {}".format(para3))
    return wrapper_accepting_parameters

@decorator_with_parameters
def print_full_name(first_name, last_name, country):
    print("I am {} {}. I love to teach.".format(
        first_name, last_name, country))

print_full_name("Asabeneh", "Yetayeh",'Finland')
```

## Advantages of Using Decorators in Python

Decorators in Python provide a powerful and flexible way to modify or extend the behavior of functions or methods. Here are some key advantages of using decorators:

1. Code Reusability:
    Decorators allow you to encapsulate common functionality and apply it to multiple functions or methods. This promotes code reusability and avoids duplicating code across different parts of your program.

2. Separation of Concerns:
    Decorators help in separating concerns by isolating specific functionality in a decorator function. This makes the code easier to understand, maintain, and modify, as each concern is addressed in a separate decorator.

3. Cleaner Syntax:
    Decorators provide a clean and concise syntax for modifying functions. Instead of cluttering the original function with additional code, decorators let you keep the core logic of the function separate from the additional behavior.

4. Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP):
    Decorators support aspect-oriented programming by allowing you to add cross-cutting concerns (such as logging, authentication, or caching) to functions without modifying their core logic. This enhances modularity and makes it easier to manage cross-cutting concerns.

5. Dynamic Behavior:
    Decorators enable dynamic behavior by allowing functions to be modified or extended at runtime. This flexibility is particularly useful when you need to adapt or enhance the behavior of functions based on specific conditions or requirements.

6. Readability and Maintainability:
    Decorators can improve code readability and maintainability by keeping the main functionality of a function separate from auxiliary features. This makes it easier to grasp the purpose of a function at a glance.

7. Code Organization:
    Decorators contribute to a cleaner code organization by grouping related functionality together. This can lead to a more modular and structured codebase, making it easier to navigate and comprehend.

8. Frameworks and Libraries:
    Many Python frameworks and libraries leverage decorators to implement features like middleware, route handling, and method validation. Understanding decorators is essential for working with these tools and contributing to the Python ecosystem.

In conclusion, decorators in Python offer a versatile and elegant way to enhance the functionality of functions or methods. They contribute to code reusability, separation of concerns, and improved code organization, making them a valuable tool in Python development.


## Built-in Higher Order Functions

Some of the built-in higher order functions that we cover in this part are _map()_, _filter_, and _reduce_.
Lambda function can be passed as a parameter and the best use case of lambda functions is in functions like map, filter and reduce.

### Python - Map Function

The map() function is a built-in function that takes a function and iterable as parameters.

```py
    # syntax
    map(function, iterable)
```

**Example:1**

```py
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] # iterable
def square(x):
    return x ** 2
numbers_squared = map(square, numbers)
print(list(numbers_squared))    # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
# Lets apply it with a lambda function
numbers_squared = map(lambda x : x ** 2, numbers)
print(list(numbers_squared))    # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

**Example:2**

```py
numbers_str = ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']  # iterable
numbers_int = map(int, numbers_str)
print(list(numbers_int))    # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

**Example:3**

```py
names = ['Asabeneh', 'Lidiya', 'Ermias', 'Abraham']  # iterable

def change_to_upper(name):
    return name.upper()

names_upper_cased = map(change_to_upper, names)
print(list(names_upper_cased))    # ['ASABENEH', 'LIDIYA', 'ERMIAS', 'ABRAHAM']

# Let us apply it with a lambda function
names_upper_cased = map(lambda name: name.upper(), names)
print(list(names_upper_cased))    # ['ASABENEH', 'LIDIYA', 'ERMIAS', 'ABRAHAM']
```

What actually map does is iterating over a list. For instance, it changes the names to upper case and returns a new list.

### Python - Filter Function

The filter() function calls the specified function which returns boolean for each item of the specified iterable (list). It filters the items that satisfy the filtering criteria.

```py
    # syntax
    filter(function, iterable)
```

**Example:1**

```py
# Lets filter only even nubers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # iterable

def is_even(num):
    if num % 2 == 0:
        return True
    return False

even_numbers = filter(is_even, numbers)
print(list(even_numbers))       # [2, 4]
```

**Example:2**

```py
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # iterable

def is_odd(num):
    if num % 2 != 0:
        return True
    return False

odd_numbers = filter(is_odd, numbers)
print(list(odd_numbers))       # [1, 3, 5]
```

```py
# Filter long name
names = ['Asabeneh', 'Lidiya', 'Ermias', 'Abraham']  # iterable
def is_name_long(name):
    if len(name) > 7:
        return True
    return False

long_names = filter(is_name_long, names)
print(list(long_names))         # ['Asabeneh']
```

### Python - Reduce Function

The _reduce()_ function is defined in the functools module and we should import it from this module. Like map and filter it takes two parameters, a function and an iterable. However, it does not return another iterable, instead it returns a single value.
**Example:1**

```py
numbers_str = ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']  # iterable
def add_two_nums(x, y):
    return int(x) + int(y)

total = reduce(add_two_nums, numbers_str)
print(total)    # 15
```

## ðŸ’» Exercises: Day 14

```py
countries = ['Estonia', 'Finland', 'Sweden', 'Denmark', 'Norway', 'Iceland']
names = ['Asabeneh', 'Lidiya', 'Ermias', 'Abraham']
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```
