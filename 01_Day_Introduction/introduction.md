## What is Python?
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity. It is widely used in web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.

## Installing Python
To get started with Python, you need to install it on your computer. Follow these steps:
1. Go to the official Python website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Download the latest version of Python.
3. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

## Hello, World!
The first program every programmer writes is the "Hello, World!" program. In Python, it looks like this:

```python
print("Hello, World!")

# To run this program, open a text editor, write the code, save the file with a .py extension and run it using the Python interpreter:)

python hello.py

# Basic Syntax
 # Python code is known for its clear and readable syntax. Here are a few key points:


# Python uses indentation to define code blocks.


# Comments start with the # symbol.

# (Example:)
# This is a comment
if 5 > 2:
    print("Five is greater than two!")
    
# Variables and Data Types

# In Python, variables are used to store data. You don't need to declare the type of a variable, as Python is dynamically typed.


x = 5       # Integer
y = 3.14    # Float
name = "Alice"  # String
is_student = True  # Boolean

# Operators

# Here are some basic operators in Python:

print(2 + 3)   # addition(+) - This line prints the result of adding 2 and 3.
print(3 - 1)   # subtraction(-) - This line prints the result of subtracting 1 from 3.
print(2 * 3)   # multiplication(*) - This line prints the result of multiplying 2 by 3.
print(3 / 2)   # division(/) - This line prints the result of dividing 3 by 2.
print(3 ** 2)  # exponential(**) - This line prints the result of raising 3 to the power of 2.
print(3 % 2)   # modulus(%) - This line prints the remainder of dividing 3 by 2.
print(3 // 2)  # Floor division operator(//) - This line prints the result of floor division of 3 by 2.

# Checking Data Types

print(type(10))                  # Int - This line prints the data type of 10, which is an integer.
print(type(3.14))                # Float - This line prints the data type of 3.14, which is a float.
print(type(1 + 3j))              # Complex - This line prints the data type of 1 + 3j, which is a complex number.
print(type('Asabeneh'))          # String - This line prints the data type of 'Asabeneh', which is a string.
print(type([1, 2, 3]))           # List - This line prints the data type of [1, 2, 3], which is a list.
print(type({'name':'Asabeneh'})) # Dictionary - This line prints the data type of {'name':'Asabeneh'}, which is a dictionary.
print(type({9.8, 3.14, 2.7}))    # Set - This line prints the data type of {9.8, 3.14, 2.7}, which is a set.
print(type((9.8, 3.14, 2.7)))    # Tuple - This line prints the data type of (9.8, 3.14, 2.7), which is a tuple.

# Don't worry if you don't understand everything right now. You'll get more comfortable with these concepts as you progress through the challenge.
